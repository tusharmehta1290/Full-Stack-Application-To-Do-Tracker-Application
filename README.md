# Full-Stack-Application-To-Do-Tracker-Application
This is my second major project. This particular application is based on microservice architecture for backend using Spring Boot and for frontend I have used Angular. Databases: MySQL and MongoDB.
Steps to run the application:
First open the spring service based application and let it load all the dependancies. 
The authentication service is using the MySQL DB, change the username and password as per your MySQL.
After that run the main classes of each spring service start from the eureka server so that you can see all the active instances of every service.. after that run the API Gateway service to have a single entry point for the API Requests and then you can run services in any order.
Then you need to move to the front end area and let all modules to get imported.
Once done, Run the command, ng serve to run the application.
